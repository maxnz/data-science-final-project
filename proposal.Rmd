**Website(s) you plan to scrape or data sets you plan to merge**

We plan to use [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com), which has data on the FIRST Robotics Competition dating back to at least 2002.

**Variables you plan to acquire, including variables you plan to generate from your raw data **

We have successfully already pulled match data for each year. For each year, we have the following data.

Variable Name          Description
--------------------   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
year                    Year that the competition took place
event_key               Unique key for the event
week                    Week of the season that the event took place
event_type              Type of competition (i.e. championship, district, regional, etc.)
comp_level              Level of competition (i.e. qualifying, quarters, semis, finals)
key                     Unique key for a match of a specific event
match_key               Unique key for a match
set_number              Number to identify different comp_level matchups
match_number            Number to identify which match during a competition
blue_score              Total score of blue alliance
red_score               Total score of red alliance
blue_alliance_(1-3)     Each of the team keys for the 3 blue alliance teams
red_alliance_(1-3)      Each of the team keys for the 3 red alliance teams
--------------------   ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Questions you plan to address **

- Do scores improve as the season progresses?
- Do scores improve as a competition progresses?
- Do teams that attend multiple competitions perform better during later competitions?
- Do teams with lower numbers (i.e. have been around longer) perform better than teams with higher numbers?


**Format of your final product and visualizations you envision **

We will produce a final report along with presentation slides to show our findings and analysis. If we have extra time, we may also create a dashboard with some of our plots.
