## Updates to your proposal â€“ what has changed in terms of websites scraped, variables acquired and generated, questions addressed, visualizations planned, and format of your final product

Not much has changed since our proposal. We have successfully scraped data from [The Blue Alliance](https://www.thebluealliance.com).
We have adjusted our scraping approach to just make it more efficient because we are working with some *very* large data sets.
We pull the data once, then cache it to a .rds file that can be loaded later.
Our variables acquired represent the ones in the table from the project proposal.
The questions we want to address are still the same, but we may come up with more after working with the data more.
As for the format of our final product, we will have a report with our methods, plots, and analysis.
We will also produce presentation slides.
If time allows, we will create a dashboard to better display our plots and results.


## An update on how your data scraping is coming

Like mentioned before, we have successfully scraped data for over 140000 matches between 2002 and 2019.
We have been working on organizing this into data frames in optimal ways for us to produce plots.

Current tables are:

Contains one row per match played, with all data associated with that match in one row.
